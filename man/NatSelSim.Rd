\title{Simulating natural selection through time in a bi-allelic gene}
\usage{
NatSelSim(
  w11 = 1,
  w12 = 1,
  w22 = 0.9,
  p0 = 0.5,
  n.gen = 10,
  plot.type = "animateall",
  print.data = FALSE,
  knitr = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{w11}{Number giving the fitness of genotype A1A1. Values will be
normalized if any genotype fitness exceeds one.}

\item{w12}{Number giving the fitness of genotype A1A2. Values will be
normalized if any genotype fitness exceeds one.}

\item{w22}{Number giving the fitness of genotype A2A2. Values will be
normalized if any genotype fitness exceeds one.}

\item{p0}{Initial (time = 0) allelic frequency of A1.
A2's initial allelic frequency is \code{1-p0}.}

\item{n.gen}{Number of generation that will be simulated.}

\item{plot.type}{String indicating if plot should be animated.
The default, "animateall" animate all possible panels.
Other options are "static" (no animation), "animate1", "animate3", or
"animate4". Users can animate each panel individually (using
\code{plot.type = "animateX"}, with X being the panel which one wants to
animate (so options are  "animate1",  "animate3",  and "animate4"
(see return for more info).}

\item{print.data}{Logical indicating whether all
simulation results should be returned as a \code{data.frame}. Default value
is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{knitr}{Logical indicating if plot is intended to show up in RMarkdown files made by the \code{Knitr} R package.}
}
\value{
If \code{print.data = TRUE}, it returns a \code{data.frame}
containing the number of individuals for each genotype through time. The
plots done by the function shows (1) Allele frequency change through time.
(2) The adaptive landscape (which remains static during the whole simulation,
so can't be animated), (3) Time series of mean population fitness,
and (4) Time series of genotypic population frequencies.
}
\description{
\code{NatSelSim} simulates natural selection in a bi-allelic gene through
\code{n.gen} generations.
}
\details{
If any value of fitness (i.e., \code{w11}, \code{w12},
\code{w22}) is larger than one, fitness is interpreted as absolute fitness
and values are re-normalized.
}
\examples{

#using the default values (w11=1, w12=1, w22=0.9, p0=0.5, n.gen=10)
\donttest{NatSelSim()}

# Continuing a simulation for extra time:
# Run the first simulation
sim1=NatSelSim(w11 = .4, w12 = .5, w22 = .4, p0 = 0.35, 
n.gen = 5, plot.type = "static", print.data = TRUE, knitr = TRUE)

# Then take the allelic frequency form the first sim:
new_p0 <- (sim1$AA[nrow(sim1)] + sim1$Aa[nrow(sim1)]*1/2) 
# and use as p0 for a second one:

NatSelSim(w11 = .4, w12 = .5, w22 = .4, p0 = new_p0, n.gen = 5, plot.type = "static", knitr = TRUE)
